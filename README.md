# hello-world

I'm Harroop and I study Quantitative Finance at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (and I think I want to have an additional major in Computer Science!).

In my free time, I enjoy playing board games with my friends and demolishing cereal in the wee hours of the night. Other than that, I like hiking, and by hiking, I mean the honey barbeque fries at McDonald's.
